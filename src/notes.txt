where should I go with plan to generate my own music styles? I mean generate music according to
existing styles? well I have a motif. I arrange the motif in various ways in order to fit
chords and rhythmic models. and fit a shape.

harmonic model... I'm clueless. how do you make something that sounds like good tonality? well
we know we have motifs. we have a chord progression. I don't want to ram it into a chord
progression rigidly but need to. so then we have some way of studying whether we have created
an unpleasant harmony, or a pleasant harmony. probably have some basic categories of types of
harmony, chords.

is there any way I could work on categorization of harmony types? probably easiest to have
material to work with and I get that through searching. 

what's the simplest search I can do? 

how about we have a list of chords, we search the deployment of motifs such that the emphasized
notes, rhythmic accented, land on those chords

we can deploy a motif in a way that is successful in terms of the outline of the notes, the
points, beats that outline a particular harmony, but the notes in-between might not sound
good. we will have examples that sound good, and those that don't. first-level way of looking
at it is that certain harmonies, or complexity of harmony, occurs in the bad-sounding ones. it
tells us what to avoid.

each can be analyzed in terms of harmonic content: this can be intervals that are present, 

what concepts do we want to incorporate: how about single melody, motif, outline. outline means
that some notes will stand out, others will be subordinate, tend to be avoided.
