-- A loudness curve is made of segments. The begin Loc of each segment is
-- its key in the Map. The begin and end dynamic levels, and the end Loc,
-- are in the data type DynSeg. 
--
-- Sucessive segments may or may not be contiguous. That is, if two keys
-- k1 and k2 appear in the map where k2 is the next key greater than k1, 
-- then the end Loc of the segment at k1 may be equal to k2 or may be less
-- than k2. If it is less than k2, this implies the presence of a hole.
-- If we perform a map lookup at loc X, and X is in one of the holes (or
-- before the first segment or after the last segment) then the computed
-- result will be 0.
