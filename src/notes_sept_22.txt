PROCESS OF CONVERTING XML DOC TO Map Loc (Map Int Chord)

- preliminary chords.. no ties done yet
  - lMapMaybe xMsrDataToNote: (filter out just notes)
    - Map Loc [XMsrData] -> Map Loc [XNote]
  - M.map groupNotesByVoice
    - Map Loc [XNote] -> Map Loc (Map Int [XNote])
  - Maybe put grace notes in here with 32nd note duration? we would need
    to look for all grace notes at a given Loc and produce new (Loc,Map Int [XNote])
    as well as modify 

  - M.mapWithKey (noteMapToChordMap msrInfo)
    - Map Loc (Map Int [XNote]) -> Map Loc (Map Int PrelimChord)

- do ties
