-- need to know staff names, for each staff there are two Moog instr. moog
-- instr hold mainly stream/chan.
--
-- curves
--
--   should curves be across entire composition, or just normalized to 0 to 1?
--   well I'm assuming that we mark a section in the composition, a segment,
--   with a name such as "c". in the configuration for this composition, we
--   define a curve "c". we aren't going to put locations in the config. we
--   don't want to assume a certain duration... or do we? duration in beats?
--   certainly not in seconds as that could change with changing tempo. I
--   think it's easiest to assume the curve will be defined to run from 0 to 1
--   and that will be mapped onto the composition every segment marked
--   "c". that way we can reuse curve definitions, and general curves will be
--   handy.

-- applyCurve1
--
--   The idea is that we have some named curves, called "generic curve." An
--   example is a curve named "Nodin" that is a gentle arc starting at zero,
--   peaking at 127, and returning to zero. The domain of a generic curve will
--   always be the interval on the x-axis [0,1].
--
--   A generic curve is then "applied" to places in the composition that are
--   sepcified by bracket marks. A pair of bracket marks has a name, such as
--   "Nodin", and spans (loc1,loc2) on a particular staff. A name such as
--   "Nodin" may appear in more than one bracket mark on a staff, or appear at
--   least once on multiple staves. We'll call the appearance of a bracket
--   mark with a particular name X an "instance" of X.
--
--   The goal of this function is to apply a particular generic curve, input
--   parameter 'curve', to the staff 'staffName' between the locations 'brBeg'
--   and 'brEnd'.
--
--   The following algorithm is needed:
--
--     - determine the stream number associated with this place in the
--       staff. The staff layout will already be determined, so it is possible
--       to look up the track number associated with this region of the
--       staff. This region must be laid out on a single track, continuously,
--       or else this routine will throw an exception.
--
--       - this starts by finding the overlap of the conversion range,
--         'msrBeg' to 'msrEnd', with the bracket range.
--
--     - using input parameter 'ctrlName' look up the MIDI channel and
--       controller number associated with that control.
--
--     - compute the begin and end time, in seconds, associated with 'brBeg'
--       and 'brEnd', and create a sequence of times that are 0.02 seconds
--       apart
--
--     - at each time, map that time to a time X within the normalized generic
--       curve (that is, scale to some point between 0 and 1), query the value
--       of the curve at X, round it to an integer, and produce a control
--       point
