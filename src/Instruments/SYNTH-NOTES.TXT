organizing synthesized music with Falcon, Moog, and Reaper

  what varies?

     the source of music is different: 

       Sibelius files, like Bach fugue or my own compositions
 
       algorithmically generated music

       piano roll note entry

  the method of configuration of the synthesizer is different

    HIGHEST LEVEL: Reaper or Logic files

      these unite 

        all virtual instruments (including more than one kind in same file)

        assigning them to MIDI devices and channels

        putting fader and pan on them
 
        have EQ

    LOWEST LEVEL: Falcon instruments or Moog patches

      these could be reused as part of a nuew Reaper file

      these exist one-to-one with MIDI "dest" (interface & channel)

      contain all the (1) patching (presence of oscillators, etc.), (2)
      control settings , (3) midi channel assignments to controls

    MEDIUM LEVEL: Falcon multis

      several Falcon instruments combined. can be reused as part of new
      Reaper file

    LOW LEVEL:

      template Falcon instruments

      assigning midi channels to controls: these can be saved and reused
      independently in Moog. Part of template Falcon instrument

  what data types are we using in cac/Instruments?

    Any: very generic 

      you give a 'note function' and a 'mod function' to be defined any way
      you like

      AnySimple: a helper data definition. 

        fill out the fields of this structure with functions and data 

        pass it to 'makeAnySimple'

    Synth: based on bracket functions

      you give it a set of *named* channels 

        a channel holds the configuration for one MIDI dest channel, most
        likely a virtual instrument

      and a set of *named* bracket function

        which contain a function that converts SNotes to MIDI notes and MIDI
        controls aimed toward one or more the named channels

    SynthExamples

      SimpleBracketFunc: you fill out the data and pass it to
        'simpleBracketFunc'
