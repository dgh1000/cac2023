--                      Sibelius and the grand staff
--
--           (regarding voice numbers of Directions and Notes)
-- 
-- Note that Sibelius alters the voice numbers of Notes on lower staff. So
-- the question here is whether it does that with Directions also. The answer
-- is, with some and not others.
--
-- Metronome markings: 
--
--   These don't have a voice in Sibelius' internal representation. In the
--   example it exported them as staff 1, voice 1.
-- 
-- Words.
--
--   System text like rit. and accel. was exported with no voice given.
--
--
--   Technique and Expression text:
--
--      Did alter them to match lowest note voice on each staff, regardless
--      of which voice they were attached to.
--
-- Dynamics
--
--   Do match the notes
--
-- Wedge and Pedal
--
--   In one case a <wedge> did not have a voice.
--
--   In other cases Sibelius did not alter them to match the notes. Instead
--   they matched the orginal voices. When processing them
--
-- Custom trill symbols in XDOtherDirection
--
--   Did alter them to match lowest note voice on each staff, regardless of
--   which voice they were attached to (I think that trills are actually
--   considered by Sibelius to be attached to the staff rather to a specific
--   voice)
