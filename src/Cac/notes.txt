What's the likeliest method of producing music I like, as fast as possible? 

Ideas

  "optimizing search method" ... we try different ideas and have some kind of
  fitness function that we are optimizing. 

    A very flexible kind of model. Can express all sorts of musical patterns
    by assigning them high fitness, and expresses the idea of searching for
    rare and special combinations ideas... music that is many things at once.

    Good music has this kind of pattern... everything is cool at once.

  "Direct generation" ... an algorithm produces the results without needing to
  search.

    No better way to guarantee strong underlying patterns. 

    

  Outline... build up a composition step by step by applying various
  transformations. Could be a search method, or "fixed" method with no
  flexibility. Could

Cac for producing broadly entertaining music, with synthesis

abstractions

  a note with an instrument: INote

    some instruments will work by splitting note into more INotes with other
    instruments

    INote doesn't include MIDI channel

  controls: CCtrl

    controls a "channel", an abstract notion of some way to control aspect of
    timbre of sound
