This document lays out how generic, configurable search works.


abstraction of search
------------------------------

Writing a general backtracking search algorithm with evaluation:

  - we have some structure type C that can be built step by step

  - we have the step data type S

  - evaluation of a partially-built structure is done with functions called
    "eval units" (EUs)

These functions are needed to implement it:

  - given C, get a list of choices 'next steps' ('choicesFunc')

  - given C, get a list of eval units ('getEus')

  - given C and a step S, combine S with C and produce C2

  - given a step S, look up its unique 'step id'
