this directory: for analyzing samples in terms of doing pvs analysis
and then constructing series of f-tables for playback


system for storing spectrum analysis information:

-- with each instrument directory, there will be files of type .spc

-- name is prefixed with m<midiPitch>_

   followed by sas : slow attack from silence
               srs : slow release into silence
               fas : fast attack from silence

               ss  : steady-state spectrum for a given pitch
                     (this is an encoding of Map Int Float)
