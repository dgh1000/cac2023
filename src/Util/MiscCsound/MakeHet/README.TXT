the file makeHet.hs is a program to analyze a bunch of wav files and
generate a bunch of het files for each wav.

The het files have a fundamental frequency that is rounded to the
 nearest integer. this program will also generate a table of
 actual frequencies and rounded frequencies, which is needed for
 accurate playback
