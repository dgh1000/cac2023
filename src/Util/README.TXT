PROJECT LEFT OFF IN MIDDLE:
  analyzing samples and putting in "hetro format" for reading by adsyn
  the directory is Util/MiscCsound/MakeHet



Notes, Oct 8 2011

Goal: generate viola samples for use with CsoundPlayer app.

Existing code: I can't figure out what code I used before.

New code:
  all new code for these purposes will go in

  haskell\Util\CsoundPlayerSamplesGen

  also README.TXT is there for directions to do this (in case I don't
  do it for a while and forget how)
