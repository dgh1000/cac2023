- generate initial sample files

  - pick instrument from among Garritan instruments
  - decide which pitches to use for samples
    - make files
      - start aria; load the instrument
      - for each pitch P
        - make a file with a few seconds of that pitch by 
          - set audio output file in aria
            (name this file pinitial<P>.wav; for instance pinital36.wav)
	    (choose the direction of the file as
            c:\Temp\ariaOutput\<instrument name>)
          - start aria recording
          - with mouse, press the key for a few seconds.
            PRESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KEY. PROBABLY BEST TO STICK TO
            WHITE KEYS so we know that we are pressing in the middle of
            the key (I'm not sure how Aria decides where a black 
            press happens)
          - stop aria recording
  - edit the haskell program trimSamples.hs so that the input/output directory
    is the same place you put the samples above. you may wish
    to edit other configuration such as the trim times (begin and end
    of interval of input wav which is maintained)

  - run trimSamples.hs (load in ghci and type main)
  
  - this will make file p<midi pitch>.wav for every input file,
    storing it in the current directory - you will need to copy these
    files somewhere more sensible

- generate csound code and haskell code

  - edit haskell program codeGen.hs to point to the directory used
    above. Edit it to set the base csound table number

  - run it, and it will put code in the current directory in the
    file "output.txt"

  - this will include a haskell-syntax list of numbers which is the
    list of pitches used, and csound code that goes in the csd for 
    loading each of these files as tables
