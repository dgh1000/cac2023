code to put near experimental modifications for MuseScore: MUSESCORE. also putting this
near attempt to figure out current logic for Sibelius files


Okay so Sibelius doesn't attach a voice to chord notes and MuseScore does. Where in
my code am I enforcing no voice on a chord note and can that change?
Can I just assume that chord note has same voice as previous note?

goal: locate how staves are computed from musicxml, in particular the output of a piano score
  in MuseScore
functions:
  - in RunOnce.hs:273, a call to parseXScore. could attach debugging to this variable 'xd'
  - parseXScore

12/27: Next steps: allow for dynamics on both staves of a piano score

- Strategy: 
  - make a set of voice numbers for every staff (v.n.'s that appear on that staff)
  - current hypothesis: there is no overlap in v.n.'s between staves
  - read the staff number of any dynamic markings and make one list of dynamic markings
    for each staff
  - create base dynamic curve for each staff. Duplicate it for each voice on that staff.
  - Final result is one dyn. curve for each voice. The rest proceeds as before. 

- Learn how dynamics work now.
  - what is Curve?
    - Curve = Curve [OneCurve]
    - OneCurve = (Map Double (Seg Double)) TimeSigs (Map Double Loc)
    -             ^ segments versus time              ^ how to convert time back to Loc 
    --                                                  for some purpose (maybe just debugging)
    - Seg a = Seg Double a a   <end> <value1> <value2>

  - abstraction of all types of dynamics markings
     data DynMark = DmLev1Simple Double
                  | DmLev1R Double
                  | DmLev1L Double
                  | DmLev1LR Double Double
                  | DmLev2R Double
                  | DmLev2L Double
                  | DmLev2LR Double
                  | DmHairpin HairpinType Loc


  - what is stored in TrState?
    - _trStateLoudnessMaps :: Map String (Map Int Curve) -- clearly one curve per voice number

  - what does Dynamics.hs do?

    - staffLev1 and staffLev2 operate on a list of DynMark
      - staffLev1 :: TimeSigs -> AbsTimeMap -> Map Loc [DynMark] -> Staff -> OneCurve
                                                                    ^ only used for true end
      - staffLev2 :: TimeSigs -> AbsTimeMap -> Map Loc [DynMark] -> Staff -> OneCurve
                                                                    ^ not used at all
      - New staffLev1, staffLev2
        - staffLev1 :: TimeSigs -> AbsTimeMap -> Map Loc [DynMark] -> Loc -> OneCurve
        - staffLev2 :: TimeSigs -> AbsTimeMap -> Map Loc [DynMark] -> OneCurve

- new stuff
  - added to Staff: stVoiceMap :: Map Int Int

- new stuff in Dynamics.hs
  
  - doStaff :: TimeSigs -> AbsTimeMap -> Staff -> [Curve]

  - hpDynCurves :: Map String AbsTimeMap -> Score -> Map String Curve
    will become :: Map String AbsTimeMap -> Score -> Map String [Curve]

  - combineDynHairpin :: Map Loc [Dynamic] -> Map Loc Hairpin -> Map Loc [DynMark]

  - split by staff :
    Map Int Int -> Map Loc [Dynamic] -> [Map Loc [Dynamic]]
    Map Int Int -> Map Loc Hairpin -> [Map Loc Hairpin]

- apply hairpins and dynamics to proper sc. soft. staff
  - will need to split up by score software staff
  - how do MuseScore & Sib. distinguish where a hairpin or dynamic marking is?
    - staff number? voice number?
