want to start using keyswitch with QL. want things to be configurable in
config file and score markings and IH (interpreted Haskell). don't really know
what I need, want to try variety quickly. configure what trill uses, what
short uses, when to extend notes. 

so the score needs to indicate which keyswitch to use, the config needs to
show that a keyswitched patch is available at a certain dest. we might also
keep the DXF patch on another dest


we need definition for note that is not short, not part of a trill
