re are reworking all manner of translation

  major new class is Meta. it contains lots of functions and data that define
  its behavior. it has a name, data to define it (such as a list of staves it
  covers), functions to create loudness curves, to determine velocity of note,
  holds state of curves and other parameters.

what does translation need to do?

  for all staves: create base time map

  for each staff: 

     create time map

     create curves: at a minimum, loudness

     make MIDI events

       note-related: nominal timing, then put in gaps or legato extend, and
       come up modifiers
