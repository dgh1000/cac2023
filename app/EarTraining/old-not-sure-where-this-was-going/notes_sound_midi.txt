data T = MIDIEvent T
       | ...

recursive data definition? no a constructor for T 
maybeMIDIEvent : probably converts only if T is a midi event

maybeVoice :: T -> Maybe (Channel, T) : Channel plus some event
TrackEvent = (ElapsedTime, T) : seems to be used to indicate time
  between events
get :: C parser => Fallible (T parser) T

for parser being instance of C, 

toFile :: FilePath -> T -> IO ()
